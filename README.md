# Distributed Traffic Simulation

This project simulates a distributed traffic system featuring moving spheres on a randomly generated network. Developed as part of CPSC 5387 – Distributed Computing (Fall 2024), the project combines Python-based nodes for simulating car and sensor behavior with Godot for visualization.

## Features

- **Network Simulation**: Randomly generated road network.
- **Distributed Nodes**:
  - **Cars**: Nodes representing vehicles moving along the network.
  - **Sensors**: Nodes monitoring vehicle positions.
- **Visualization**: Real-time rendering of the simulation using Godot.

## How It Works

- Cars move along the randomly generated network based on predefined logic.
- Sensors periodically report data about the cars' positions.
- The Godot visualization reflects the current state of the simulation in real time.
